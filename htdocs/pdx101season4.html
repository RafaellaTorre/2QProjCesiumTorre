		<h2 style= "clear: left">X1</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>X1 (stylized: 엑스원)holds the meaning "10 + 1" as "X" is the Roman numeral for 10 and combined with the cardinal number, 1, to represent the group's 11 members.
		The group debuted on August 27, 2019 with the mini-album "비상 : Quantum Leap", which had the title track, "Flash" featured the group's version of "U Got It" and 
		"MOVE" which were performed on Produce X 101's concept evaluation, and "X1-MA" as a CD-Only track.  Although, the group's contract was valid for five years, due 
		to the Produce Rigging Controversy, the group went on a hiatus, starting on November 10, 2019. On January 6, 2020, representatives from each of the members' 
		agencies met up and voted on whether or not X1 would continue their activities, the condition was that the group would only continue if all the companies were in 
		agreement. Dispatch reported that out of the 9 companies, 4 were in agreement, 4 disagreed, and the remaining company's vote was voided due to the uncertainty on 
		how the ballot would be read. As 4 companies disagreed, it was concluded that the group would not continue anymore and it was announced that X1 officially disbanded 
		later that day.</p>
		
		<p>After X1's disbandment, Kim Yohan debuted as a soloist on August 25, 2020 and then redebuted as a member of WEi on October 5, 2020; he also debuted as an actor

		mini-album "Nostalgia". Song Hyeongjun and Kang Minhee both debuted under the boygroup "CRAVITY" on April 14, 2020, alongside 7 of their labelmates. Cho Seungyoun returned 
		to being a soloist and made a comeback on June 29, 2020, with the mini-album, "Equal". Son Dongpyo debuted under the boygroup Mirae (previously known as DSP Sprouts) on 
		March 17, 2021. Nam Dohyun and Lee Hangyul formed to duo "H&D" ib April 21, 2020 and debuted with the group "BAE173" later that year, on November 19. Cha Junho debuted with
