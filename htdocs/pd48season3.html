		<h2>Description</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>Airing on Fridays of 2018, from June 15 to August 31, Produce 48 is the third season of Mnet's Produce franchise, unlike the other programs
		under the franchise, the numbers 101 cannot be found in the title and is instead replaced by the numbers 48, derived from the name of the Japanese 
		idol group AKB48, who Mnet collaborated with, in the making of this season. In contrary to the title, there are actually 96 trainees who participated 
		in this season, 48 coming from South Korean companies and the remaining 48 from the members of AKB48 and their sister girlgroups (e.g. HKT48,NMB48, etc.).
		The program still follows the usual flow of the 2 previous seasons, however, instead of debuting an 11-membered group, this season aims to debut a 12-membered
		girlgroup that would promote for 2 and a half years, in both South Korea and Japan, and is the only season out of all the four to do so. Not only this, 
		but the program had also made adjustments by adding Japanese songs for the evaluations and also adding a Japanese version to "Nekkoya", this season's 
		version of the first two season's "Pick Me".
		</p>
		
		<p>Some notable trainees in this season are:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Miyawaki Sakura - who was a high-ranking member of HKT48 for 2 years in a row and was predicted to win the next Senbatsu election, she was the center for Nekkoya and made the belief amongst the show's fans that the center for each season's "Pick Me" will debut</li>
		<li>Matsui Jurina - one of the most senior members of SKE48 and had placed first on all Senbatsu Elections since 2009 </li>
		<li>Jang Wonyoung - who got the nickname "Born-to-be Center" because of her amazing facial expression and the fact that she was a center during the group and concept evaluations</li>
		<li>Jang Gyuri - who was currently in fromis_9, a girlgroup from another Mnet reality survival show, who had just debuted on January 8 of the same year</li>
		<li>An Yujin - a trainee who had appeared on many commercials, including a cosmetics commercial with Astro's Cha Eunwoo and Ailee's music video for "Thirst" to promote Gatorade</li>
		<li>Kim Minju - a trainee who had recently acted in the kdrama "Tempted"</li>
		<li>Lee Chaeyeon - who got the nickname "survival show addict" as she had alreay appeared in two other survival shows, namely, "K-pop Star 3" and "Sixteen"</li>
		</ul>
